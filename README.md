Developed a comprehensive home automation and AI-driven surveillance system 
using Raspberry Pi as the central hub. The system integrates with various home electrical systems, allowing users to 
control appliances via a mobile application. Advanced surveillance capabilities were implemented using AI models to 
monitor CCTV feeds for intruders and fire hazards, providing real-time alerts and notifications.
